## General Information
The project uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.
Company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

## Conclusions
- Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding Credit Loss:
Grades, Annual income, DTI, Pub_rec_bankruptcies and Verification Status

## Technologies Used
Python
Libraries are Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, MatplotLib and Plotly
